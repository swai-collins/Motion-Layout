# Motion Layout: Creating Simple Recycler View Animation 


## Description

[MotionLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/constraintlayout/motion/widget/MotionLayout) is a layout type that helps you manage motion and widget animation in your app. MotionLayout is a subclass of [ConstraintLayout](https://developer.android.com/training/constraint-layout) and builds upon its rich layout capabilities. As part of the ConstraintLayout library, MotionLayout is available as a support library and is backwards-compatible to [API level 14](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels).
